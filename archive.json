      "body": "Minutes from the ACE wg meeting on 06-June-2023:\r\n\r\n>MV (p4): comment on GH issue from MCR. Should we continue supporting server-generated private keys in EST-oscore? The hardware RNG is not enough secure for random number generation.\r\nGS: It\u2019d be good to avoid server-generated keys, but we\u2019d need first to be convinced it\u2019s a bad option to start avoiding. Otherwise we should keep it.\r\nMCR (on chat): I don\u2019t buy the \u201cwithout an OS\u201d point. If they code bare-metal, then they need to code bare-metal secure RNG, or they will have lots of problems. I haven\u2019t watched this youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuqw0-jZh9Y]\u2026 are there people in the WG who want server generated keys? Let them stand up. (I don\u2019t object to it, but I question the need).\r\nPW (on chat): I would be okay with a big fat warning that it SHOULD NOT be done unless absolutely no other way possible\r\nMV: So we can go for a big security consideration on this, and fundamentally allow it.\r\nCB: Maybe not a problem anymore with very new platforms, but practically it\u2019s still relevant. Can the server contribute to entropy? It might not fit in this document but still something to think about.\r\nGS (on chat): Something for T2TRG.\r\nCB (on chat): +1\r\nMV: Even renowned manufacturers admit to have vulnerabilities in the secure random number generation.\r\nMV: I hear consensus on keeping the option, and add a big warning in the security considerations.",

Having separate code paths for re-enrollment and initial enrollment significantly complicates the implementation of the protocol. This would be the case if we opt for EDHOC EAD transport during initial enrollment and OSCORE-based transport during re-enrollment.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to require EDHOC be executed on re-enrollment, just like during the initial enrollment. Given the PSK-based rekeying work that is going to happen in LAKE, we could transport the re-enrollment messages in the optimized rekeyed handshake. We'd still need to keep the dependency on OSCORE in the draft in order to support other EST functions, like `/crts`. Given that, there would still be two separate code paths in the implementation: one for `/sen` and `/sren`-targeted interactions transported via EDHOC and its EAD fields; one code path for e.g. the `/crts` function transported via OSCORE.\r\n\r\nSecond option would be to keep things as-is, but to mention the use of draft-ietf-core-oscore-edhoc and piggyback OSCORE message within the EDHOC handshake. That way, the initial enrollment can happen, as you suggest, in message_3 and message_4.\r\n\r\nI think I am in favor of option 2. What are your thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nCC: @gselander  ",

Does this belong to EST-oscore?\r\n\r\nIf the `csrattrs` (`att`) format and resource is included in EST-oscore in any way (currently as OPTIONAL) then the draft must also define the format of this resource. It can re-use the existing format from EST-coaps for sure. However, since C509 \"CBOR versions\" are provided for all the other resources/payloads it would be strange to not offer this for the `att` resource.   It could be noted that this is left for future work (in this case it would be less strange -- understandable, since it's an optional feature, and there's some ongoing work still to clarify its use.)\r\n\r\nAnd it would then belong to EST-oscore, since the original application/csrattrs format is also specified purely in EST scope in RFC 7030.  (Or else it could go into a followup document of EST-oscore.)\r\n\r\nI agree that the CBOR version of the format itself should be easy to define, re-using the already specified CBOR versions of the different attributes. So the syntax should be good - semantics is still to be clarified further in another document then.\r\n\r\n",

For example, running EST-OSCORE immediately following the voucher-based authorization (draft-ietf-lake-authz), optimally using combined EDHOC and OSCORE protocol (draft-ietf-core-oscore-edhoc), would enable authentication, authorization and certificate enrolment completed in two round trips and avoiding the transport of some duplicate information.

This part could still be clarified: I initially thought the intention was to enable HTTP transport without needing CoAP at all i.e. in none of the communication legs.  This interpretation then conflicts with many following parts of the document that only mention CoAP and not HTTP used by the client. For example, paragraph 5 mentions \u201c\u2026 context, the CoAP exchange carrying \u2026 \u201c which  then triggers the question whether this is really a CoAP exchange, or whether it can also be a HTTP exchange?\r\nMaybe the intention was to support only CoAP for the client side; which might be carried as HTTP for a particular network segment? (e.g. from proxy to EST server).\r\nNot sure how to resolve this; it depends on the intention of how HTTP is supposed to be used and this is not yet fully clear to me.",

Bullet 3 mentions \u201cenrolled client certificate\u201d \u2013 is this the domain certificate that\u2019s created due to the enrollment process? I suppose the client can\u2019t use this optimization when it\u2019s not yet enrolled?\r\n\r\nIn bullet 4:\r\n\r\n- is the advantage here that the client never has to actually access/download its own domain certificate? E.g. it keeps using a reference to it, instead of the actual certificate?   Does this mean that all future/potential servers and peers will have to support this \u201ccert reference\u201d instead of the real cert?\r\n\r\n- when would the EST server return the reference rather than the full certificate?  It seems the client is also obliged to support the cert references then, adding to its codebase.\r\n\r\nAll of the \u201ccertificate reference\u201d optimizations seem to complicate matters in terms of interoperability. If device 1 MAY send a reference, this forces device 2 to support (MUST) a method to get the certificate using this reference to e.g. check it.
